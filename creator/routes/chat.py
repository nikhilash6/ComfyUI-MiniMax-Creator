"""`/continuity/chat/*`: the doors the chat room knocks on.

The room is a conversation and a queue, and those are the two things the server
has to hold up. `chat/turn` asks the refiner model what to do about one user
message and answers `{say, action?, raw}`. `chat/render` takes the action it
answered with, turns it into a blob, compiles that blob as a dry run, and puts a
one-node prompt on ComfyUI's queue. `chat/again` is the small third: an action
a card already rendered, stamped again for the rail as it is now, so a retake
follows the pills (`_stamp`). Everything between them lives in the
browser: the conversation, the ledger of what has been made, the rail. This
module is stateless on purpose — the spec's §5.5 — so a reload starts fresh and
nothing here has a session to lose.

**The thinking is next door.** `creator/chat.py` owns the action schema, the
parse, the re-ask protocol, the machine card and the two blob patches, and it is
pure. What is here is the joining that cannot be: which files are on this disk,
what this machine last picked, what the compiler says about the result, and the
queue. That is the same line `refine_routes.py` draws against
`families/refine.py`, and it is why the whole protocol can be tested without a
server and tuned on `tools/chat_bench.py` without a browser.

**Two backends, one shape.** The remote refiner is answered inside the request,
exactly as the refine button's is and for the same reason: it spends somebody
else's GPU, so there is nothing for it to queue behind. The in-process one is a
4B model on the card the render wants, so it rides the queue as a `chat` job and
the reply arrives on `executed` under `ui.continuity`. The turn object is the
same either way, and the remote one is wrapped in `{"result": …}` because that
is the envelope `queue.run()` reads: it resolves with `answer.result` where the
reply carries one and waits for `executed` where it does not, so one call site
in the room covers both backends. `/continuity/refine` says it the same way.

**The re-ask is a second call inside the same job**, never a round trip to the
browser. The room asked one question and is owed one answer; a correction the
person watches happen reads as a failure, and on the queued path it would be a
second wait behind whatever is running.

No native tool calls yet. Where a runtime reports tool support the same schema
is the one tool, but the fenced form is the fallback and the default, and it is
what both backends get here — the seam is `_ask` below, which is the one place
a reply is produced.
