// The room's *Thinks with* popover: the model that turns what you say into a
// prompt, and how it writes.
//
// One popover for everything about the writing, kept apart from everything
// about the drawing (the *Makes with* sheet in `chat.js`). The word "model"
// meant four things in this room — the thinker, the image family, the video
// family, the edit family — and "sampling" meant two: how a text model picks
// its next token and how a diffusion model picks its next step. Here the
// thinker is the only model, and the dial is called what it does.
//
// **The choice is the refiner's** (`refine.settings`), on purpose: the same
// backend, the same model, the same server card. A machine set up once for
// the node's Refine button is set up for its chats, and the other way round.
// What the refiner popover also carries — the per-mode templates, the
// prompting modes, the rewrite's language — is the rewrite's business and
// does not reach a chat turn (`chat.requestBlock` sends none of it), so none
// of it is drawn here. The verbosity dial and the skill are the room's own
// (`settings.chat`) and are drawn here because they are about the writing.
//
// **Only models that can chat are listed.** The refiner's list is every
// file under models/text_encoders, and half of those are the encoders the
// renders load — H3's 32B Qwen, LTX's Gemma, a CLIP-L, a T5 — which cannot
// hold a conversation or, worse, can, at a size nobody would choose. A file
// picked as some family's encoder in `settings.weights` is still offered,
// because it is a real choice on a small disk, but it says which family
// loads it; a file that is not a language model at all is left out.
