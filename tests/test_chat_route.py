"""The chat render route builds over the node on the canvas.

    COMFYUI_PATH=~/ComfyUI <comfy-venv>/bin/python3 tests/test_chat_route.py

`tests/test_chat.py` pins the pure half — what a turn's action becomes over a
base blob. This is the route's half, which needs the node classes: that the
base the room sends is read and refused as it should be, that the node's own
widget values ride into the prompt over the family's defaults, and that a
render built for a clip carries the piece's sampler row, stack and turbo
switch rather than anything re-derived here. Nothing is queued and no model
folder has to hold a file: the listing and the machine's picks are stood in.

Skips itself with a message if ComfyUI cannot be imported.
